# sevenrealms-bot

This repository provides a custom [Nonebot](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2) based QQ bot frontend designed for a student circle.

## DEPRECATED

Using [Nonebot](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2) to build a QQ bot is getting hard for me to maintain. And it's time for me to migrate to [Satori](https://satori.chat/) and [Koishi](https://koishi.chat/) platform, which only needs to build some plugins.

Therefore, I shut down the repository, but not stops the project.
